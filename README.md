# Unit testing with dyalogscript in the cloud

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is GitHub's powerful automation framework. It allows you, for example, to execute tests on pushes, spin up environments (Linux, MacOS, Windows) etc. It's a commercial product, but with a very generous free tier.

Our aim is to utilise `dyalogscript` to make automated testing easy "in the cloud" using GitHub Actions.
